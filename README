Package: Collie
Version: V00-04-13

Collie is a limit setting software suite.  The structure is divided
into two pieces: file I/O and limit calculation.  Thus, the procedure
is broken into two steps: creating Collie I/O files and evaluating a
limit.

The software requires some base libraries:

ROOT (v5_25 or greater)

As of collie V00-04-00, the dependencies on the CLHEP and MINUIT
packages have been migrated inside the collie release.  This now
reduces the need for a specific effort on the part of users to port to
arbitrary operating environments.  
==>The CLHEP release included is v2.0.4.5.  
==>The MINUIT release is modified to allow up to 200 parameters in a
   given fit.

There is a Makefile which will generate four libraries and the
executables in the collie/examples directory. A successful build of
the collie package will create the following files:

collie/lib/libCollieIO.so 
collie/lib/libCollieLimit.so
collie/CLHEP/lib/libCollieCLHEP.so 
collie/minuit/lib/libCollieMinuit.a

collie/examples/collieIOcondenser.exe  
collie/examples/collieLimitCalc.exe  
collie/examples/resultsFileCombiner.exe
collie/examples/collieIOmaker.exe      
collie/examples/collieXsecCalc.exe
collie/examples/collieFastApprox.exe   
collie/examples/collieXsecFitLoader.exe


***Begin*********Instructions for Setup at DZero**********************

Using tcsh: Use the collie/setup_Collie.tcsh script to perform your setup for Collie.

Using bash: Use the collie/setup_Collie.bash script to perform your setup for Collie.

***End*********Instructions for Setup at DZero**********************

Non-DZero users may modify the setup scripts to ensure that the
ROOTSYS environment variable is specified.  This should satisfy the
only external dependence.  Also, collie is currently developed to
build with gcc V3.4.3 and has not been tested explicitly with gcc V4.
